## Add or remove tags

Tags are keywords that you can assign to catalog assets and use them in the search for assets. You can create tags using both lowercase and uppercase. The search, however, converts everything to lowercase. For example, a search for `MyCatalog` returns both tags: `mycatalog` and `MyCatalog`. You can also use the `_ - () \ []` special characters to create your tags.

1. From a selected asset, click **Tags**.
2. Enter the new tags separated by commas.
3. Press `Enter` to add the new tags to the list of tags.
4. Click **Save**.

## Enable manual approvals

You can change the approval settings of subscription requests for a catalog asset. By default, all subscription approvals are automatic.

To enable manual approval of subscription requests:

1. From a selected asset, click the **pen** icon.
2. Select **Manual** from the **Subscription approval** drop-down.
3. Click **Save**.

## Share a catalog asset

Unified Catalog allows you to control who can view and subscribe to catalog assets. You can make your asset public to all members in your organization or share it with specific teams. The following sharing options are available:

* **All member if this team** - Only members of the owning team can view and subscribe to the catalog asset.
* **Specific teams** - Only members of the selected teams can view and subscribe to the catalog asset.
* **All members of this organization** - All registered members in the organization can view and subscribe to the catalog asset.
  
Follow these steps to share your catalog asset.

1. Click the **Explore catalog** side menu.
2. Click the asset you want to share.
3. Click **Share** and choose an option.
4. Click **Save**.
